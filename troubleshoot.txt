Common Errors
Sometimes you run into issues when you run your project. Here you will find the most common issues and how to solve them.

Address in use or similar
The most common reason for an error thrown by your app stating that a port or address is in use is the fact that some process is already running/listening on that port/address. You need to take a look for those and kill the processes conflicting with your app:

// Find the process
lsof -i tcp:$PORT
If any relevant process is running you will get a list looking like this:

COMMAND PID   USER   FD   TYPE   DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
apache2 699 ubuntu    4u  IPv6 83213152      0t0  TCP *:http-alt (LISTEN)
You now can kill that proccess. Make sure you replace PID with the ID of the process.

// Kill the process
kill -9 PID
For the console wizards:

kill -9 $(lsof -i:$PORT -t)
